        <h1> The German Shepherd</h1>
        </header>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>German Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs. The breed standard height at the withers is 
            60–65 cm for males, and 55–60 cm (22–24 in) for females. German Shepherds are longer 
            than they are tall, with an ideal proportion of 10 to ​8 1⁄2. The AKC official breed standard 
            does not set a standard weight range. They have a domed forehead, a long square-cut muzzle 
            with strong jaws and a black nose. The eyes are medium-sized and brown. The ears are large and 
            stand erect, open at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during movement. 
            <em>A German Shepherd has a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at a 
            fast pace as well as stalking.</em> The tail is bushy and reaches to the hock.</p>
        <p><strong>German Shepherds have a double coat which is close and dense with a thick undercoat.</strong> 
            The coat is accepted in two variants: medium and long. The gene for long hair is recessive, a
            and therefore the long-haired variety is rarer. Treatment of the long-haired variation differs 
            across standards; it is accepted but does not compete against standard-coated dogs under the 
            German and UK Kennel Clubs while it can compete with standard-coated dogs, but is considered 
            a fault, in the American Kennel Club. The FCI accepted the long-haired type in 2010, 
            listing it as the variety b, while the short-haired type is listed as the variety.</p>
